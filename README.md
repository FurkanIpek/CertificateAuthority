Cryptography Course Project

Purpose is to develop a "Certificate Authority"

Some of the cryptographic algorithms are to be developed by hand, for some of them, we are allowed to use libraries.

The project has three phases:
• Developing a cryptographic toolbox for CA server and client
• Developing the protocol for certificate generation and delivery
• Developing a public key cryptography application


Note: CryptoPy 2.6.1 is used in utils.py
